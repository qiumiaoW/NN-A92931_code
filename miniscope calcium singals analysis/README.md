## raw data
  The folder of raw data includes the calcium imaging Î”F/F results of Calb1+ and Tnc+ PF neurons in response to pinch, lick and attack (files: dffstructcalbtail.mat and dffstructtnctial.mat); the folder also includes the IDs of responsive neurons identified based on the criteria described in the paper (Folders: calb_responsive_neuron and tnc_responsive_neuron)
  ## for decoder
 decoder_lickvsattack.ipynb contains Python code implementing a convolutional neural network used for decoding analysis. The input data and resulting decoding outputs are provided in this folder.
  ## code
MATLAB (R2018a) scripts for basic analyses, including heatmap generation, identification of responsive neurons, and response pattern visualization, are included in this folder.
  ## for affinity
affinity_calculation.ipynb contains Python code for performing k-means clustering analysis of neuronal affinities. The data used in this code can be downloaded at [].
